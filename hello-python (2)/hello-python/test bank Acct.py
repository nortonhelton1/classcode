# TDD Test Driven Development 
# 1. Write a failing test 
# 2. Make the test pass 
# 3. Refactor 
# 4. Repeat 

# UNIT TESTS RULES 
# 1. Unit Test should be independent 
# 2. Unit Test should NEVER wait for human input 
# 3. Unit Tests should be repeatable 

# WHAT TO TEST 
# 1. DOMAIN/MODELS/BUSINESS LOGIC 
# 2. You should write UI Test for your webpages, automated tests, integration tests 
# 3. Code Coverage refers to the code which is under test

# importing unitest module which contains classes/functions to help us test
